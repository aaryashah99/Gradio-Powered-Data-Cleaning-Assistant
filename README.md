# Data Cleaning Assistant (with Gradio + NLP)

An interactive Gradio application that allows users to upload a CSV file and perform data cleaning operations using natural language commands. Results can be downloaded or saved directly to an SQLite database.

> Powered by `pandas`, `Gradio`, `SQLAlchemy`, and a custom NLP parser for hands-free data wrangling.
